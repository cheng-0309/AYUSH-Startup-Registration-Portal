# Implementation Status

**Verified:** 11 November 2026  
**Scope:** Repository state in the `main` working tree. The design and API documents below describe the target system unless this page says they are implemented.

## Current state

| Area | Implemented now | Not implemented or not verified |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19/Vite portal screens for public, startup, officer, and admin roles; client-side routes; demo login; seven-step application prototype; status badge and timeline mapping. | Pages are not connected to backend APIs. Client-side route guards are for demo navigation and do not enforce security. |
| API client | Axios base URL from `VITE_API_URL` with `http://localhost:3005/api` fallback; Bearer-token request interceptor; centralized error-message helper; wrappers prepared against `api-contract.md`. | The wrappers have no screen/context consumers yet. `AuthContext` does not store a backend token. |
| Frontend state | `AuthContext`, `ApplicationContext`, and `NotificationContext` still use mock data and browser storage. The new-application demo keeps the full form snapshot locally and uses an internal `mock-…` record ID. | No server-generated tracking number is available in the demo. The UI explicitly does not display a fabricated one. |
| Backend | CommonJS Express scaffold listens on port 3005, enables CORS/JSON parsing, and exposes `GET /api/health`. | Authentication middleware and business route files are absent. No live API workflow is implemented. |
| Prisma | Prisma 7 models map all 11 tables; migrations create tables, indexes, foreign keys, and CHECK constraints; Prisma Client is generated. | Express routes/services are not integrated with Prisma. |
| SQL database | `database/schema.sql`, `seed.sql`, and `queries.sql` remain available as the standalone SQL/DBMS scripts. The Prisma migration history is the reproducible setup path for the backend. | Seed/query scripts are not part of the Prisma migrations. Use one schema-creation path on a fresh database; do not run the destructive SQL schema script over a database initialized by migrations. |
| File handling | UI placeholders and a reusable client-side file-selection component exist. | The new-application wizard and document centre do not persist uploaded files to the API or private server storage. |

## Phase A1 frontend preparation

- The API client now follows the documented route paths where wrappers exist, including officer queues, queries, notifications, admin users, resources, and categories.
- `statusHelpers.js` maps the canonical API statuses to display labels and colors, with safe handling for unknown values. The status badge and timeline use this mapping while remaining compatible with existing mock display labels.
- The new-application mock flow retains all seven-step fields locally, shows save/submission feedback, prevents duplicate clicks, and does not generate a tracking number.
- The frontend `.env.example` already contains `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3005/api`; environment files are ignored by Git.
- Auth, application, and notification contexts remain mock-backed until the backend routes and response behavior are available.

## Integration gaps to resolve

The API contract is the agreed target. Before live integration, account for these mappings and gaps:

1. Map category selection to `ayush_categories.code`, not a UUID.
2. Translate uppercase API roles/statuses to lowercase/title-case database values.
3. The application ID is the formatted tracking number; an optional `trackingNumber` alias may return the same value.
4. Application regulatory/business data uses flexible JSONB fields; founders belong to the startup profile.
5. The upload UI says 10 MB and allows DOC; the database default is 5 MB and `.pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png`.
6. The API contract uses `CLIENT_URL`, while `.env.example` and `server.js` use `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`.
7. `certificate_number` is legacy/internal only and must not be presented as a statutory license, AYUSH approval, or legal certification.
8. The schema lacks activation, uploader, persistent resource, and review timestamp fields; do not assume these are persisted.

## Verification

- `npm run db:validate` passed and Prisma Client was generated. A previous `npm run db:status` confirmed both migrations applied. Database credentials are not recorded here.
- `npm run build` passed with dependency comment and bundle-size warnings.
- `npm run lint` could not start because ESLint 9 requires an `eslint.config.*` file, which is absent from the repository.
- Browser check confirmed demo startup login, local draft feedback, mock document metadata, and navigation through the wizard to its review step. No backend submission was made.
- Runtime database connectivity and backend API behavior remain unverified.
