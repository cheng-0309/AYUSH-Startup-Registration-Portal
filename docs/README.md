## Current implementation status

The frontend still uses mock-backed contexts and the Express server currently provides a health check. The PostgreSQL schema is now mapped in Prisma and tracked through migrations; business API routes and live frontend integration remain future work. See [implementation-status.md](./implementation-status.md) for the verified state and remaining integration gaps.

## 📌 Phase 1: Requirement Analysis & Project Setup

| Document | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)** | Core objectives, Ministry of AYUSH & AIIA context, functional requirements (FR-1 to FR-7), non-functional requirements (security, scalability, usability), and MVP vs. future scope. |
| **[`user-roles.md`](./user-roles.md)** | Detailed role specifications (*Startup Applicant*, *Government Reviewer*, *Administrator*), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) matrix, and Mermaid Use-Case diagram. |
| **[`application-workflow.md`](./application-workflow.md)** | Complete end-to-end registration lifecycle, state transition machine (`Draft` $\rightarrow$ `Submitted` $\rightarrow$ `Under Review` $\rightarrow$ `Clarification Required` $\rightarrow$ `Resubmitted` $\rightarrow$ `Approved` / `Rejected`), and workflow flowchart. |
| **[`tech-stack.md`](./tech-stack.md)** | Selected technologies (React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM) and their academic and architectural justifications. |
| **[`architecture.md`](./architecture.md)** | High-level 3-tier system architecture, tier-by-tier component interactions, inter-tier communication protocols, and security threat mitigations. |

## 🗄️ Phase 2 — Chunk 1: Database Analysis & ER Design

| Document | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`ER-diagram.md`](./ER-diagram.md)** | Complete Mermaid ER diagram showing all 11 finalized database entities, primary and foreign keys, relationship cardinalities (1:1, 1:N), and optional vs. mandatory constraints. |
| **[`database-design.md`](./database-design.md)** | Comprehensive 3NF relational database specification. Details entity attributes, suggested PostgreSQL data types, primary and foreign keys, candidate entity rationalization, and design decisions. |
| **[`database-workflow.md`](./database-workflow.md)** | Concrete mapping of React frontend views and context states to database operations, sequence diagrams of the review and clarification cycle, document verification state machine, and ACID transaction boundaries. |

## ⚙️ Phase 2 — Chunk 2: Relational Schema & PostgreSQL Implementation

The PostgreSQL DDL, sample data, and query scripts reside in the root [`database/`](../database) directory. The canonical database model is mapped into Prisma in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`, with its reproducible migration history in `backend/prisma/migrations/`:

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`database/schema.sql`](../database/schema.sql)** | PostgreSQL DDL defining 11 tables, keys, foreign keys, CHECK constraints, and indexes. |
| **[`database/seed.sql`](../database/seed.sql)** | Fictional sample records for the SQL schema, including demo users, applications, and documents. |
| **[`database/queries.sql`](../database/queries.sql)** | Comprehensive SQL demonstration queries covering CRUD, multi-table INNER/LEFT JOINs, GROUP BY aggregations, CTEs, subqueries, ACID transactions, and Recharts analytics feeds. |
| **[`database/README.md`](../database/README.md)** | Setup guide, execution order, demo account credentials, and PostgreSQL execution verification. |

Commit `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and all files under `backend/prisma/migrations/`. They are the shared database history. Do not commit `.env` files, database URLs, or `node_modules`.

## 🔌 Phase 2 — Chunk 4: API Contract & Backend Integration

| Document | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`api-contract.md`](./api-contract.md)** | Agreed target HTTP contract for base URL, JWT auth, shared enums, Prisma model fields, route ownership, endpoint shapes, errors, status labels, uploads, and team constraints. Backend business endpoints are not implemented yet; see [implementation-status.md](./implementation-status.md) for integration gaps. |
