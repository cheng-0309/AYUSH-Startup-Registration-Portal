# Functional and Non-Functional Requirements Specification

## 1. Project Overview

The **AYUSH Startup Registration Portal** is a centralized digital platform developed to streamline, accelerate, and standardize the registration and regulatory compliance process for startups operating within the AYUSH sector (**A**yurveda, **Y**oga & Naturopathy, **U**nani, **S**iddha, and **H**omoeopathy).

Under the initiative of the Ministry of AYUSH and the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), this portal bridges the gap between emerging innovators, regulatory authorities, and administrative bodies. It addresses existing bottlenecks such as opaque manual paperwork, decentralized workflows, delayed verifications, and fragmented tracking mechanisms.

## 3. Project Scope & MVP Boundaries

To deliver a reliable and maintainable system within the timeline of the Advanced Software Development (ASD) and Database Management Systems (DBMS) curriculum, the scope is divided into **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and **Post-MVP Enhancements**.

### 3.1 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Core Features
1. **User Authentication & RBAC**: Secure signup, login, and session management for three roles: *Startup Applicant*, *Government Official / Reviewer*, and *Administrator*.
2. **Startup Registration & Profile Submission**: Comprehensive multi-step form capturing company details, AYUSH discipline, directors/partners, and product/service descriptions.
3. **Document Upload & Management**: Secure uploading, validation (file size, format), and viewing of mandatory compliance documents (e.g., Certificate of Incorporation, AYUSH drug license/testing reports, GST/PAN).
4. **Review & Decision Workflow**: Reviewer dashboard to inspect applications, verify attached documents, approve, reject with remarks, or raise queries.
5. **Clarification & Query Handling**: Bidirectional communication channel allowing reviewers to flag specific issues and applicants to submit corrected documents or responses.
6. **Real-time Status Tracking & History**: An interactive timeline showing the exact status of an application (`Draft`, `Submitted`, `Under Review`, `Query Raised`, `Resubmitted`, `Approved`, `Rejected`).
7. **Basic Admin Oversight**: User management and basic dashboard metrics (total applications, approved, pending, rejected).

### 3.2 Post-MVP / Additional Features (Future Scope)
- Automated Aadhaar / DigiLocker integration for founder identity verification.
- Automated OCR and document authenticity verification.
- SMS gateway integration for multi-channel alerts (MVP will prioritize in-app and email-ready notifications).
- Integration with external intellectual property (patent) and clinical trial registries (CTRI).
- Advanced AI-assisted preliminary compliance scoring and duplicate detection.
