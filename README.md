# AYUSH Startup Registration Portal

A comprehensive digital platform designed to streamline, digitize, and standardize the registration process for startups operating across the AYUSH sector (**A**yurveda, **Y**oga & Naturopathy, **U**nani, **S**iddha, and **H**omoeopathy).

Developed as part of the **Advanced Software Development (ASD)** and **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** curriculum, this portal addresses existing inefficiencies in traditional registration processes by enhancing transparency, accelerating regulatory reviews, and securing sensitive compliance documentation.

## 🏛️ Project Background & Problem Statement

* **Domain / Category**: MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech (Software)
* **Initiating Organization**: Ministry of AYUSH
* **Department**: All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA)

The AYUSH sector is experiencing rapid entrepreneurial growth with innovative formulations, wellness products, and digital healthcare solutions. However, startups often encounter challenges in navigating opaque, decentralized, and manual registration processes. 

The **AYUSH Startup Registration Portal** solves this by offering a centralized single-window system that connects **Startup Applicants**, **Government Officials / Reviewers**, and **System Administrators** in a transparent, accountable, and secure workflow.
